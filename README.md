This is another project that i've done using HTML5 CSS and Javascript.
this took me longer to finish, i met a lot of problems finding the right logic for some functions.
but in the end i finally made it, this project was a fun experience for me to have, 
and also a lesson for me to learn more about developing logic for a code.
